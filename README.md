## Tutorials for ITC Course Observing and quantifying surface water in a changing world (2023-2A)
### Module 5: Lake extent and hypsometry

In this tutorial, we look at the [Hydrafloods](https://github.com/Servir-Mekong/hydra-floods) python package - an open-source surface water mapping tool developed by Servir-Mekong. 

- In the [first notebook](https://github.com/ITC-Water-Resources/itc-hydrafloods-2024/blob/main/notebooks/01-Tonle_Sap_Indonesia.ipynb), we look at surface water extent observations over the Tonle Sap in Indonesia. Servir-Mekong has an operational framework with hydrafloods to monitor the surface water extent in the study region, and is an interesting example to look at. Huge shoutout to @mickymags for providing the example case study as a part of the [ITC-Servir partnership](https://www.itc.nl/alumni/70-years-of-itc/timeline-stories/SERVIR-program/).

- In the [second notebook](https://github.com/ITC-Water-Resources/itc-hydrafloods-2024/blob/main/notebooks/02_Beledweyne_Flood_Somalia.ipynb), we look into the Somalia flood of 2023. We have provided an incomplete structure with some support for students to practice the new skills they have learned over the module. However, we strongly caution that, the Somalia flood 2023 notebook has been created strictly for the purpose of the tutorial and has not been validated against the ground reality. As such, the notebook may not to be used "off the shelf" to analyze the event without prior validation of the results.
